    "Not long after buying and publicly consuming a $6.2m banana as part of an artworld stunt, Chinese crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun made another eye-catching purchase, investing $30m ($23.5m) into a cryptocurrency firm called World Liberty Financial.\n",
    "\n",
    "The company had foundered since its October launch, investors seemingly leery of its prospects and its terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "But it boasted a potentially enticing feature: the chance to do business with a firm partnering with and promoted by none other than Donald Trump.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr Sun's investment tipped the company over the threshold that allowed the president-elect to begin profiting from the venture. Trump and his family are now in the position to collect roughly $20m - and potentially far more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr Sun, who is currently fighting fraud charges in the US related to his own crypto business, did not respond to questions about what prompted his interest in the tokens, which cannot be traded.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the episode set off alarm bells among government ethics experts, who see it as an indication that Trump's expanding business ventures have made it easier than ever for those hoping to influence US policy to steer money his way.\n",

    "\"Unlike most politicians, President Trump didn't get into politics for profit – he's fighting because he loves the people of this country and wants to make America great again.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "New opportunities\n",
    "Trump has faced questions about conflicts of interest before.\n",
    "\n",
    "During his first term as president, the Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC became a symbol of the issue, as a go-to place for lobbyists, foreign diplomats, and allies to stay and spend.\n",
    "\n",
    "Critics argued that the hotel created a way for Trump to profit indirectly from his office. He faced accusations and lawsuits alleging he violated the US Constitution's ban on presidents receiving foreign emoluments – or profiting from their office.\n",
    "\n",
    "But experts said the growth of his business empire, which now includes a publicly traded social media company, a cryptocurrency firm, and ties to a Saudi-backed golf league, makes it possible for anyone hoping to curry favour to move money more quietly and in much greater sums.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The scale has increased and the ease has increased,\" said Michael Ohlrogge, a law professor at New York University, who has studied Trump Media, which operates Truth Social and currently represents the bulk of Trump's $6bn fortune. \"You can only book so many hotel rooms.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "On Truth Social, for example, Prof Ohlrogge said a foreign government or business could purchase ads convincing investors the firm was gaining traction, prompting a pop in its share price.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though Trump Media commands a market value of more than $7bn, there has been little sign of such activity so far. The company reported less than $5m in ad sales this year.\n",
    "\n",
    "But given the stock market's \"amplifying\" effect, Prof Ohlrogge said it would not require a lot of spending to lead to potentially significant gains for Trump, who owns more than half the shares of the company.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"His pro-crypto stance\"\n",
    "Nowhere is the entanglement between Trump's business interests and his public duties as stark as in the crypto industry, where he has deepened his personal involvement, while simultaneously promising to champion it while in the White House.\n",
    "\n",
    "His plans include regulatory rollback and ideas such as a national Bitcoin reserve, in which the government would stockpile the cryptocurrency.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"One of the most important issues to be determined over the next couple years is how crypto is regulated,\" said Virginia Canter, chief ethics counsel at the nonpartisan Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. \"Well now, he's an active player in the crypto market. How it could be regulated [could] affect his personal wealth, what kind of position he takes.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Nik Bhatia, founder of Bitcoin Layer, a firm that advocates investments in Bitcoin, said it would be a mistake to dismiss Trump's stance on crypto as driven only by his own financial interests.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I don't see these moves motivated by self-interest - I see them representing the electorate,\" he said.\n",
    "\n",

    "With her award-winning Wolf Hall series of books, Hilary Mantel made Tudor bad guy Thomas Cromwell sympathetic. But as TV adaptation Wolf Hall: The Mirror and the Light premieres in the US, the question is: did she also 'sidestep crucial matters'?\n",
    "\n",
    "Nearly 500 years after his death, Thomas Cromwell lives again, reborn in the popular imagination thanks to novelist Hilary Mantel, and her Wolf Hall trilogy. For decades, historians piled layer after layer of interpretation upon Henry VIII's astute chief minister, a key figure in the Reformation, when King Henry broke from the Catholic Church to establish his own Church of England. But now, with the emergence of Mantel's fictional Cromwell – so attractive, so splendidly presented – the real man is in danger of being buried forever.\n",
    "\n",
    "Going forward, Cromwell's name will likely call to mind the lean, canny look of actor Mark Rylance – star of the television adaptations of the Wolf Hall series – rather than the grumpy, heavy-jowled visage captured by artist Hans Holbein in a portrait done from life circa 1534. And a figure once counted among history's villains will retain the glow of Mantel's revisionist high regard for many years to come.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "National Portrait Gallery The famous Hans Holbein portrait of Cromwell portrays him as a grumpy individual (Credit: National Portrait Gallery)National Portrait Gallery\n",
    "The famous Hans Holbein portrait of Cromwell portrays him as a grumpy individual (Credit: National Portrait Gallery)\n",
    "Starting on 23 March, US audiences can watch Rylance play Cromwell, alongside Damian Lewis as King Henry, one more time. Six hours of Wolf Hall: The Mirror and the Light, based on the third and final book, make up the last tranche of episodes of the BBC's lavish costume drama. The script takes the complicated story of Cromwell's fall, culminating in his execution for treason in 1540 after six years as the King's right-hand man, and renders it (relatively) easy to follow. Especially impressive is the dialogue, often lifted directly from Mantel's text. The author, who died of a stroke in 2022, had a gift for rendering 16th-Century speech in a non-risible way. (The Wolf Hall novels have also been adapted into two plays.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Although critics consider The Mirror and the Light to be the least successful of the novels – it's the only one of the three not to win the Booker Prize – the TV version received rapturous reviews when broadcast in the UK last autumn. The Guardian's five-star review proclaimed: \"The final instalment of Hilary Mantel's masterpiece is the most intricate television you are ever likely to see. It is so beautifully made it's breathtaking.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Fact v fiction\n",
    "But where do sumptuous production values end, and the facts begin? Such questions have accompanied Mantel's project from the start. Tracy Borman, Chief Historian at Historic Royal Palaces and author of 2015's Thomas Cromwell: The Untold Story of Henry VIII's Most Faithful Servant, tells the BBC about the impact Mantel's first Tudor novel, Wolf Hall, had on her upon its publication in 2008. \"All through my education, from early school days until university, I was taught that Henry VIII's chief minister was a grasping, ruthless, cynical henchman, driven by greed and power. Then I read Wolf Hall and it gave such a different perspective… I was inspired to write a non-fiction biography so that I could find out where the truth lay.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "Researching her book, Borman discovered a sharp-witted and enterprising Cromwell, as Mantel did, and realised just how thorough the novelist had been in mining primary sources for innumerable details, including Tudor swear words, Cromwell's favourite wines, and the names of his servants. \"Granted, she took artistic license when she needed to,\" Borman says. \"Notably in downplaying Cromwell's role in Anne Boleyn's execution, and in making him something of a heartthrob at court.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Samantha Rogers, who teaches early modern history at Vanderbilt University, agrees. \"There are a great many popular novels about the Tudors I can't bear to read,\" she tells the BBC. \"Mantel's work is the gold standard – well-researched and rooted in history. However, to paint a largely sympathetic portrait of Cromwell, she does sidestep some crucial matters.\"\n",

    "The Cook Islands is proving that sustainable tourism isn't just possible – it's essential. Here's how this South Pacific nation is preserving their paradise for generations for come.\n",
    "\n",
    "Landing on Rarotonga, the largest of the Cook Islands chain felt like stepping back in time. Gazing out of the taxi from Rarotonga airport to our resort, we were immediately struck by the absence of high-rise hotels, fast-food restaurants and corporate chains. There were no traffic lights, only coconut palms lining the road, the scent of salt and frangipani drifting through the air and the jungle meeting the ocean in a seamless panorama. It felt like Hawaii in the 1960s: uncrowded, laid-back and refreshingly authentic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our taxi driver pointed to a low-slung resort along the shoreline. \"No building can be higher than a coconut tree,\" she said. This isn't just a local tradition but a law set in 1965 by the Cook Islands' first premier, Albert Henry, to prevent overdevelopment. She explained that only Cook Islanders can own land, ensuring that large corporations don't dominate the landscape. We looked out onto hotels blending naturally into their surroundings and white-sand beaches ringed with long green parks, all free from litter and crowds.\n",
    "\n",
    "We soon learned that this preservation of paradise is deeply intentional. Cook Islanders have made a conscious effort to ensure that Rarotonga never follows the path of overdevelopment seen in places like Honolulu. Instead, locals have committed to conservation, low-impact tourism and sustainable practices that benefit both locals and visitors. \"People come here because it is a paradise uncluttered by overdevelopment,\" explained Jeremy Goodwin, regenerative tourism manager for the Cook Islands Tourism Corporation (CITC). \"Our sacred duty as custodians of the land is to look after our paradise.\"\n",
    "\n",

    "The Cook Islands' population of 21,000 is spread over 15 islands (Credit: Getty Images)\n",
    "The Cook Islands, an archipelago of 15 islands between New Zealand and Hawaii, has been self-governing in free association with New Zealand since 1965. With a total population of 21,000, the islands are divided into two groups: the Southern Cook Islands, which includes the more accessible Rarotonga and Aitutaki, and the remote Northern Cook Islands, made up of low-lying coral atolls. Cook Islanders have their own Māori language, with different dialects across the islands. And while tourism is a key industry, the islanders have ensured that sustainability remains at the nation's core.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"For hundreds of years, the protection of the Cook Islands relied on the traditional Ra'ui System where access to a particular resource or area is forbidden for a given period,\" explained Karla Eggelton, CEO of CITC. \"The system aims to conserve food resources and protect ecological conditions in lagoons, reefs and other marine resources.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Thoughtul Travel\n",
    "\n",
    "Green Getaways is a BBC Travel series that helps travellers experience a greener, cleaner approach to getting out and seeing the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "This philosophy persists today – and extends beyond the sea. On the northern island of Pukapuka, for example, locals have practiced sustainable living for centuries, packing up their belongings and sailing by boat to another atoll within the lagoon for seasonal periods to prevent resource depletion. They fish and farm only what they need, maintaining a delicate balance with nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "On arrival at The Rarotongan Beach Resort and Lagoonarium, staff welcomed us with a warm \"Kia Orana\", a greeting that translates to \"may you live long\". It's a unique gesture of friendship from islanders renowned for their hospitality and warmth. The resort overlooks the Aroa Lagoonarium, a snorkelling haven and a sanctuary for butterflyfish, parrotfish and angelfish. Part natural lagoon and part enclosed habitat, it is designed to support marine conservation, serving both as a coral nursery and a protected area for marine life to flourish.\n",

    "The popular Muri Night Market offers a Rent-a-Plate project to reduce disposable plastic (Credit: Pamela and Gary Baker)\n",
    "As the days passed, we saw how sustainability is woven into everyday life across the islands. At the Muri Night Market, a popular outdoor dinner option, we watched vendors prepare island dishes like ika mata (raw fish marinated in lime and coconut milk) and rukau rukau (taro leaves in coconut cream), all using local ingredients. We were struck by the market's Rent-a-Plate project, where visitors can borrow reusable plates and cutlery instead of using disposable plastic. Cook Islanders also promote clean water initiatives. We purchased reusable bottles from the visitor's centre and refilled them at free UV-treated water stations around the island, a project led by the Te Ipukarea Society to minimise plastic waste.\n",
    "\n",
    "How to play your part\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Support the Cook Islands economy by buying local crafts, clothing and food. Attend a cultural tour or show and embrace the traditions, customs and lifestyle.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Take shorter showers to save the islands' limited water supply and minimise electricity use.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Volunteer with Muri Environment Care Group. Every Wednesday and Thursday, visitors can join efforts to protect Muri Lagoon by participating in soil restoration projects and planting native trees near streams to control sediment flow into the lagoon.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Choose eco-friendly experiences and products, use reef-safe sunscreen and avoid single-use plastics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond sustainable dining, Cook Islanders have taken marine conservation to a global scale. In 2017, the country established the Marae Moana Marine Park, making the 15 islands the world's largest multi-use marine protected area, covering 1.9 million square kilometres. The legislation also bans large-scale commercial fishing and seabed mining within 50 nautical miles of each island.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Marae Moana is the idea of shared space, a new concept of creating a sanctuary and the conservation effort that allows for shared, sustainable activity,\" said Eggelton.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also offering opportunities for sustainable tourism is Aitutaki, a bucolic island neighbouring Rarotonga that's known for its snow-white sand beaches, volcanic rock, coconut palms and crystal-clear lagoons. Here the Pacific Resort Aitutaki has launched a coral restoration project where guests can take part by affixing coral fragments to underwater mesh tables, helping regenerate the reef.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The project is an example of Mana Tiaki or island conservation,\" explains Goodwin. \"Mana Tiaki means guardianship with a sacred purpose.\" He explained that culturally, for most Polynesians, the ocean is sacrosanct. \"The beaches bring tourists to this holiday destination, but they also connect Cook Islanders to the ocean.\"\n",

    "As the days passed, we explored the endless powdery white-sand beaches that ring Rarotonga, from Aroa Beach where fiery, colourful sunsets painted the sky with hues of vivid orange and crimson to serene and scenic Titikaveka Beach. They were all pristine and uncrowded, lined by palm trees, parkways and picnic tables. Most were unobstructed, with no commercial buildings to obstruct the view.\n",

    "At Muri Beach, we opted for a sea turtle snorkelling tour. Our guide, Eric, explained the importance of turtles to the Cook Islands economically, environmentally and culturally. Daily tour operators earn an income by taking paying passengers to see these graceful, curious creatures. Plus, sea turtles are a key indicator of coastal ecosystem health, so monitoring and preservation are vital. Eric told us about a rescuer who found a turtle caught in a fishing net. Once freed, the Te Ara O Te Onu (Cook Island Sea Turtle Society) rehabilitated the turtle, as they have done dozens of times in the past. In addition to the society's efforts, visitors are encouraged to help track turtle movement through the Citizen Science Project by taking photos and sending them into the programme.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the time our trip had come to an end, we better understood how Cook Islanders have created a blueprint for preserving paradise by blending ancient conservation methods with modern environmental initiatives. \"It's about leaving both the people and the place better off than you found it,\" said Eggelton.\n",
    "\n",

      "Not long after buying and publicly consuming a $6.2m banana as part of an artworld stunt, Chinese crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun made another eye-catching purchase, investing $30m ($23.5m) into a cryptocurrency firm called World Liberty Financial.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company had foundered since its October launch, investors seemingly leery of its prospects and its terms.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it boasted a potentially enticing feature: the chance to do business with a firm partnering with and promoted by none other than Donald Trump.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Sun's investment tipped the company over the threshold that allowed the president-elect to begin profiting from the venture. Trump and his family are now in the position to collect roughly $20m - and potentially far more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Sun, who is currently fighting fraud charges in the US related to his own crypto business, did not respond to questions about what prompted his interest in the tokens, which cannot be traded.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the episode set off alarm bells among government ethics experts, who see it as an indication that Trump's expanding business ventures have made it easier than ever for those hoping to influence US policy to steer money his way.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The conflicts have grown substantially with the scope of his business empire,\" said Richard Painter, who served as the White House's chief ethics lawyer during the George W Bush administration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Getty Images Trump speaks at a Bitcoin conference in Nashville in July.Getty Images\n",
      "Trump speaks at a Bitcoin conference in Nashville in July.\n",
      "In a statement to the BBC, Trump's team shrugged off the worries.\n",
      "\n",
      "In his first term, \"President Trump removed himself from his multi-billion-dollar real estate empire to run for office and forewent his government salary,\" Trump spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Unlike most politicians, President Trump didn't get into politics for profit – he's fighting because he loves the people of this country and wants to make America great again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But Trump has taken little action in response to concerns about the potential for corruption, or appearance of it, as he prepares for a return to the White House.\n",
      "\n",
      "New opportunities\n",
      "Trump has faced questions about conflicts of interest before.\n",
      "\n",
      "During his first term as president, the Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC became a symbol of the issue, as a go-to place for lobbyists, foreign diplomats, and allies to stay and spend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Critics argued that the hotel created a way for Trump to profit indirectly from his office. He faced accusations and lawsuits alleging he violated the US Constitution's ban on presidents receiving foreign emoluments – or profiting from their office.\n",
      "\n",
      "But experts said the growth of his business empire, which now includes a publicly traded social media company, a cryptocurrency firm, and ties to a Saudi-backed golf league, makes it possible for anyone hoping to curry favour to move money more quietly and in much greater sums.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The scale has increased and the ease has increased,\" said Michael Ohlrogge, a law professor at New York University, who has studied Trump Media, which operates Truth Social and currently represents the bulk of Trump's $6bn fortune. \"You can only book so many hotel rooms.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "On Truth Social, for example, Prof Ohlrogge said a foreign government or business could purchase ads convincing investors the firm was gaining traction, prompting a pop in its share price.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though Trump Media commands a market value of more than $7bn, there has been little sign of such activity so far. The company reported less than $5m in ad sales this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "But given the stock market's \"amplifying\" effect, Prof Ohlrogge said it would not require a lot of spending to lead to potentially significant gains for Trump, who owns more than half the shares of the company.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"His pro-crypto stance\"\n",
      "Nowhere is the entanglement between Trump's business interests and his public duties as stark as in the crypto industry, where he has deepened his personal involvement, while simultaneously promising to champion it while in the White House.\n",
      "\n",
      "His plans include regulatory rollback and ideas such as a national Bitcoin reserve, in which the government would stockpile the cryptocurrency.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One of the most important issues to be determined over the next couple years is how crypto is regulated,\" said Virginia Canter, chief ethics counsel at the nonpartisan Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. \"Well now, he's an active player in the crypto market. How it could be regulated [could] affect his personal wealth, what kind of position he takes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Nik Bhatia, founder of Bitcoin Layer, a firm that advocates investments in Bitcoin, said it would be a mistake to dismiss Trump's stance on crypto as driven only by his own financial interests.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't see these moves motivated by self-interest - I see them representing the electorate,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "But still, he said: \"I think there probably is a conflict of interest in that his pro-crypto stance will benefit his company.\"\n",
